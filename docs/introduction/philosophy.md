# Introduction: Why Locus?

Welcome to Locus! We created this tool to help you build full-stack web applications much faster and with fewer headaches. This page explains the core ideas that drive Locus's design.

## Our Guiding Principles

Everything in Locus, from the language to the command-line tools, is shaped by three key goals:

### 1. Speed
**Build faster, from idea to deployment.**

Locus is designed to get you moving quickly. It automates the repetitive parts of web development, like setting up servers, connecting to databases, and writing boilerplate code. This means you can focus on what makes your application special, whether you're a solo developer or part of a small team.

### 2. Clarity
**Understand your entire application at a glance.**

Locus code is designed to be easy to read and understand. Instead of scattering your app's logic across many different files and languages, Locus brings it all together. You define your data, your backend logic, and your user interface in one place, creating a single source of truth that's easy to follow.

### 3. Maintainability
**Create applications that are built to last.**

Locus helps you build robust, well-structured applications by using trusted, industry-standard technologies like React and Express.js behind the scenes. It gives you a solid foundation to build upon and provides clear "escape hatches" for when you need to add custom code, so you'll never hit a hard wall.

## Is Locus the Right Tool for Your Project?

Locus is powerful, but it's specifically designed for building certain types of applications. Here’s a quick guide to help you decide if it’s a good fit for you.

-   **Locus is for building web applications.** It's not designed for creating things like operating systems, video games, or mobile apps.
-   **Locus is ideal for small to medium-sized projects.** It's perfect for business software, internal tools, and startups. It is not optimized for massive, Google-scale services that need to handle millions of simultaneous users.
-   **Locus is a code-based tool.** It's made for people who are comfortable with logic and writing text-based instructions. It is not a "no-code" or drag-and-drop platform.

## A Focused Approach

Modern web development can be incredibly complex. Locus is our answer to that complexity: an opinionated tool that's focused on making you as productive as possible.

By providing a single, clear language for your entire stack and a powerful set of tools to back it up, Locus helps you stay focused on what really matters: turning your ideas into reality.
